# Audio-Search
Audio Search using Convolutional Network

•	Conceptualizing a deep convolutional neural network architecture to search for specific audio signals in the input video file
•	Executing steps to perform feature engineering on video files, to recognize laugh tracks and output a video without them
•	Using transfer learning, data augmentation, and regularization to avoid overfitting and increasing overall model accuracy

Download the files from the data folder and the files from the google drive link. Place them in the same folder as the notebook.
Create two directories in a folder called spectrogram named 'laugh track' and 'dialogue' in the same directory.

Run the commands in the notebook.
